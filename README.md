# 🎓 Student Profile Management System (SPMS)

A Windows-based desktop application built using **Python** and **Tkinter** for managing student profiles, with plans to integrate **SQLite3** for the backend database. This is an exploration project aimed at enhancing my Python development skills.

A product of tutorial hell
